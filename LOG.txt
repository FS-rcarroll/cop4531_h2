Development Log: Assignment 2
Name: Rebecca Carroll

October 22: Set up files. Set up CLion and makefile. I can't seem to get it to generate the makefile AND get it to run gcc. Set up makefile, tested it and now creating Dynamic.cpp
October 27: Set up GitHub repo. Set up file I/O with input text files and implemented LCS method.

Questions 
1. I need to ask: If this isn't very OOP with the .h file. Will I lose points?
2. Two directories are named in linprog.
